# SNKRS News Bot
Old project from 2020 - 2021

This script tracks and sends emails about the upcoming shoes on the SNKRS app :)

I made this to stay informed about upcoming Nike shoes! Back in the day, the JSON data on the Nike SNKRS website would include shoes that didnâ€™t appear on the user interface until days later. With this script, I could find out about new upcoming shoes before anyone else.

## How to Run

  1. Clone this repository:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/juanmartin8a/SNKRS-News-Bot.git
     cd SNKRS-News-Bot

  2. Run the program: `python main.py`.
