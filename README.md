This script tracks and sends emails about the upcoming shoes on the SNKRS app :)

I made this to stay informed about upcoming Nike shoes! Back in the day, the JSON data on the Nike SNKRS website would include shoes that didnâ€™t appear on the user interface until days later. With this script, I could find out about new upcoming shoes before anyone else.
